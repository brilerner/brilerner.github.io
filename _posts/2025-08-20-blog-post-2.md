What is *Machine Learning for Healthcare* (MLHC)? It’s a conference designed to bring together two worlds: the machine learning side and the clinical side. This year marked the 10th edition of the conference, hosted in Rochester, Minnesota — home to the Mayo Clinic.

This was my second time attending. The first was in New York at Columbia, and both experiences were excellent in different ways. I’ve never actually submitted a paper — the timing hasn’t lined up with my research cycle — but in both cases I happened to be nearby, so I went and have not regretted it.

## Why I Like This Conference

One of the biggest strengths of MLHC is its **size and structure**. It’s not huge, and it’s single-track. That means no “fear of missing out” because everyone is in the same room, hearing the same talks, and starting conversations from the same baseline. I really appreciate that format — it fosters deeper discussions and makes networking feel more organic.

The program is compact: just two days, with keynote speakers each morning, roundtables for open discussion, and poster sessions. The roundtables were particularly useful for finding others who share your interests and starting conversations that could lead to collaborations.

Posters are the main mode of presentation, and there are two submission tracks: **Research Track** (full papers, broader ML-focused work) and **Clinical Abstract Track** (shorter, clinician-focused contributions). That mix brings in a diversity of perspectives. I noticed that many of the grad students leaned more toward the machine learning side, while professors tended to represent both the clinical and ML worlds.

## This Year’s Conference

Having the conference in Rochester made sense — the Mayo Clinic is a big partner — but Rochester itself is a quiet, sleepy town. It felt like attendance was a bit lower than when I went in New York. I hear next year’s conference will be in Baltimore, which I expect will boost attendance. That said, the vibe was still great: collaborative, constructive, and pretty international. I met people from Europe, South Korea, and Japan.

As you might expect, **LLMs were everywhere.** Predictive algorithms are still part of the conversation, but LLM-based work is clearly dominating, and surely that will only continue.

One talk that really stuck with me was Maya Peterson’s introduction of **Large Clinical Behavioral Models (LCBMs)** — models that predict the *next action* instead of just the next word. It’s a clever way of reframing decision support and incorporating causality into model design.

Overall, the speaker lineup was excellent, and I walked away impressed with both the range and the depth of the research presented.

## Looking Ahead

For me, MLHC was a great experience — again. It’s compact, international, and genuinely interdisciplinary. I hope to come back next year in Baltimore, this time with some of my own work to present.
